About Twitter | Our company and priorities Skip to main content About Twitter is what’s happening and what people are talking about right now. Go to Twitter.com We serve the  public conversation. That’s why it matters to us that people have a free and safe space to talk. Healthy conversations → Security and privacy → Civic integrity → Life’s not about a job, it’s about purpose. We believe real change starts with conversation. Here, your voice matters. Come as you are and together we’ll do what’s right (not what’s easy) to serve the public conversation.
